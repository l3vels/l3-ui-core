## Installation
Install the component library
```
$ npm install @l3-lib/ui-core
```

## Usage
You can import from the main bundle:
```javascript
import { Button } from "@l3-lib/ui-core";
```
or you might want to import directly the component from the dist folder
```javascript
import Button from "@l3-lib/ui-core/dist/Button";
```

You also need to import Main CSS file to your project
```javascript 
import "@l3-lib/ui-core/dist/main.css"
```

### Peer dependecies
We are relaient on React and React DOM, we are using them as externals and we don't package them to the package so you must have them in your project


## Storybook
We are using storybook in order to develop the components independently from any consumer.
run this to build & run the storybook locally:
```bash
npm run storybook
```
the storybook will be served on `http://localhost:6006`


## Developing locally with your consumer application
When developing locally we are using a npm functionality called npm link, this allows us to 
work locally on our package and use it in a different project without publishing.
This functionality basically overrides the npm mapping between package name to its repo, and points it to where the package is located locally.

### Troubleshooting local development
* If you are using NVM, make sure both packages are using the same version.
* Because we are using react hooks and having react as a peerDependency - if you want to develop locally and encounter issues with "invalid hook call" [See this github thread](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991). The quick fix is in your webpack config file alias react to resolve the node_modules path


  
Go to the project's directory and run:
```zsh
nvm use
npm unlink
npm link
npm start
```

## Committing

We use [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to lint our commit messages. This ensures that we have consistent commit messages.

Example of a good commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add settings icon"
```

Commit Types:

| Type     | Description                                                                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| feat     | A new feature for user, not a new feature for build script                   |
| fix      | A bug fix for user, not a fix to a build script                              |
| chore    | Other changes that don't modify src or test files                            |

| docs     | Documentation only changes                                                   |

| perf     | A code change that improves performance                                      |
| test     | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests                            |
| build    | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies                |
